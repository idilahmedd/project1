    <p>TO PLAY: To begin the game, each player reaches to one of the center cards 
        on the table and turns it face up. The players can now start placing cards. 
        Cards placed on one of the piles must be either one greater or one less than 
        the face value of the uppermost card on the pile. The order of the cards is 
        the standard Ace-10, Jack, Queen, King, where the values loop from highest
        back to lowest (i.e. aces placed on kings, kings placed on aces). 
        
        After a card has been placed in a pile, the player picks up one of the 
        remaining 15 cards (at the game's start) so he always has 5 cards in his hand 
        If neither of the players can place another card in a center pile, both players 
        pick up a card from the piles placed to either side of the center piles and places 
        it in the nearest center pile. If both players still cannot move, they repeat this 
        process until all cards are gone, in which case, cards from the bottom of the center 
        piles are placed on top.The game ends when one player runs out of cards in his hand.

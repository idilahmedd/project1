## Brainstorming

The idea of this game originated from my pure interest in remaking my favorite childhood game so that it can be played online. We needed to pick a game and Speed came to mind. Now, I will admit that upon choosing it I didn't thinkg right away about all that creating it would encompass. 

Safe to say that once I started really wireframing it, I realized I probably should have choosen a more simple game. There were alot of moving parts involed and it was going to be a challenge incorporating what we have learned so far and also searching out for some of the things that were new to me.

Nonetheless, I was already started and personally, I don't like to turn down a challenge. I started drawing out the game and layout so that I could visualize it to see where all the different steps were initializing and ending. I also jotted down different variable names, and functions for how the game starts and ends. 

After mapping the entire project out, I started right away in designing my grid on Html and CSS. 


## Putting it all together

As the wireframe for my project was coming together well, I quickly started on laying out my HTML and styling CSS. I did this first because I felt that I was much more stronger in Html and CSS and it can provide me with a starting point.
I first decided to to layout the player 1 field of play so that later on I could just copy the same specs to the player 2. What I did was put an array of 5 cards in the hand, another array of 15 cards in the player1 deck and an array of 12 cards in the help deck. 





# Conclusion 

This project was an undertaking to say the least. I think I must of had more than a few minor mental breakdowns and tried to scratch it and start with a whole new game but my love for challenges and pushing myself overcame those thoughts. It was especially difficult to not really have many examples or similar code to go by. But overall, I think besides all of the debugging, the most challenging part for me was incorporating the ai component without the e.target and click functionality. On that note, I feel that it could be finalized further with more CSS styling and possibly different levels where the ai is faster each time. Also, in the future, I could also incorporate different versions of the game where there are different rules but same foundations, for example California Spit is a different more difficult version.
